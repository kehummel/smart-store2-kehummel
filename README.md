## WORKFLOW 1. Set Up Your Machine

Followed the correct steps to set up machine. Most of it was already set up from projects in a previous class.

## WORKFLOW 2. Set Up Your Project

After verifying your machine is set up, set up a new Python project by copying this template.
Complete each step in the following guide.

- [SET UP PROJECT](./SET_UP_PROJECT.md)

It includes the critical commands to set up your local environment (and activate it):

```shell
uv venv
uv python pin 3.12
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
uv run pre-commit install
uv run python --version
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```shell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```



### 3.2 Run Checks as You Work


1. Update dependencies (for security and compatibility).
2. Clean unused cached packages to free space.
3. Use `git add .` to stage all changes.
4. Run ruff and fix minor issues.
5. Update pre-commit periodically.
6. Run pre-commit quality checks on all code files (**twice if needed**, the first pass may fix things).
7. Run tests.

In VS Code, open your repository, then open a terminal (Terminal / New Terminal) and run the following commands one at a time to check the code.

```shell
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
uv cache clean
git add .
uvx ruff check --fix
uvx pre-commit autoupdate
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
git add .
uv run pytest
```

NOTE: The second `git add .` ensures any automatic fixes made by Ruff or pre-commit are included before testing or committing.

`uvx` runs the latest version of a tool in an isolated cache, outside the virtual environment.
This keeps the project light and simple, but behavior can change when the tool updates.
For fully reproducible results, or when you need to use the local `.venv`, use `uv run` instead.

### 3.3 Build Project Documentation

Make sure you have current doc dependencies, then build your docs, fix any errors, and serve them locally to test.



### 3.4 Execute

This project includes demo code.
Run the demo Python modules to confirm everything is working.

In VS Code terminal, run:

```shell
uv run python -m analytics_project.demo_module_basics
uv run python -m analytics_project.demo_module_languages
uv run python -m analytics_project.demo_module_stats
uv run python -m analytics_project.demo_module_viz
```

You should see:

- Log messages in the terminal
- Greetings in several languages
- Simple statistics
- A chart window open (close the chart window to continue).

If this works, your project is ready! If not, check:

- Are you in the right folder? (All terminal commands are to be run from the root project folder.)
- Did you run the full `uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade` command?
- Are there any error messages? (ask for help with the exact error)

### 3.5 Git add-commit-push to GitHub

Anytime we make working changes to code is a good time to git add-commit-push to GitHub.

1. Stage your changes with git add.
2. Commit your changes with a useful message in quotes.
3. Push your work to GitHub.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "describe your change in quotes"
git push -u origin main
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and publish your documentation via GitHub Pages.

### 3.6 Modify and Debug

With a working version safe in GitHub, start making changes to the code.

Before starting a new session, remember to do a `git pull` and keep your tools updated.

Each time forward progress is made, remember to git add-commit-push.

### 4 Add Raw Data

I added the raw data in csv files.

### 5 Add to the data

I added errors to the data so that I could practice fixing them.

### 6 Prepare the data

I followed the format for preparing the data.

### 7 Pre-Load Data Preparation

I used the utils_scrubber.py to clean the data. I decided to make three additional python scripts in order to do this because I didn't want to erase work that I had already completed. I also wanted to be able to compare the two processes and I will be better able to do that if I have the original document to look over. The new files all have _scrub in them so that you can tell the difference.

I tried to pay close attention to the dtypes of each column so that they would be all set for data analysis.
